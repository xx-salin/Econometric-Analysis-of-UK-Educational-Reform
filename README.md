"The Effect of Incrementally Raising the Compulsory Education Age on Medium-Term Labour Market Outcomes: England’s Reforms" - Analyzed policy impacts using econometric analysis (DiD and Event Study models with PSM) in Stata.


Abstract:

As set out in the 2008 Education and Skills Act, England incrementally raised the compulsory education age from 16 to 17 in 2013 and 18 in 2015, aiming to improve labour market outcomes. Motivated by the limited literature exploring the incremental implementation of such policy, this paper investigates impacts on income and unemployment in the 7 years following the final reform. Using matched sample Difference-in-Differences and Event Study estimation on individual-level repeated cross-sectional data from APS, the empirical results suggest income significantly increased in the medium-term for those affected by the policy, while impacts on unemployment were insignificant. Therefore, policymakers should consider the effectiveness of compulsory schooling reforms on specific labour market outcomes before adopting similar policies to England.

Data info:

This paper uses cross-sectional data from the Annual Population Survey (APS) collected by the Office for National Statistics (ONS). A harmonized dataset was constructed by pooling annual data between 2004 and 2023, resulting in a repeated cross-sectional dataset covering demographic and labour market characteristics across countries in the UK. The harmonized dataset includes approximately 1,482,000 individual-level observations, averaging around 75,000 per year (2004 to 2023). After sample restrictions (further detailed in Methodology), including controlling for spillover effects and restricting birth cohort range for comparability, the analytical dataset used for modelling includes approximately 87,000 observations, averaging 4,800 per year (2006 to 2023).
